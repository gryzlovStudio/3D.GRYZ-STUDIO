## How We Work (Process)

1. **Brief (15 minutes)** — Client describes the task, goals, and references
2. **3 Concepts (1 hour)** — AI generates concept variants, client picks the best
3. **Production** — 3D artists create the final product with AI assistance
4. **Delivery** — All files in required formats with documentation and support

**Free first step:** We create 3 AI concept variants for free in 1 hour. No payment, no contracts, no obligations. Apply at: https://3dgryz.ru/get-concept/

## Technology Stack

**3D Software:** Blender, Maya, ZBrush, 3ds Max
**AI Tools:** ComfyUI, Stable Diffusion, LoRA, Wan 2.5, Kling 2.6
**Rendering:** Cycles, Octane, V-Ray
**Game Engines:** Unity, Unreal Engine
**Post-Production:** After Effects, DaVinci Resolve
**Formats:** FBX, OBJ, GLTF/GLB, USD, MP4, MOV, PNG, JPG, EXR

## Why AI-Accelerated?

Traditional 3D production is slow and expensive. We use AI to handle routine tasks:
- **Concept generation:** AI creates hundreds of variants in minutes
- **Texture creation:** Neural networks generate seamless textures
- **Background generation:** AI produces environments and backdrops
- **Upscaling:** Enhance resolution without manual work
- **Video generation:** AI-assisted animation and motion

**Result:** 5-10x faster production, lower costs, without sacrificing quality. Human artists handle the creative direction and final polish.
